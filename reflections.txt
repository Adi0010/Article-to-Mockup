You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  

with the inclusion of mockup html webpages construction, i now understand the basic html code behind a webpage rendered 
by my web browser. I have also learnt that for the same operation,there are more than one element tags defined 
which can be used.

* What has been easy?
  

the initial html syntaxes have been easy and the project rubrics was also understandable
*
 What has been difficult?
  *

until now, it has been a great journey with html basics. For the consideration of difficulty rating, i think 
it depends upon the topics which shall be introducted in the subsequent lessons.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


Your response goes here!

well my earlier assumption about knowing basic html has somehow subdued, as i learnt about new elements, attributes 
working of web browsers and their networking protocols. I also learnt about the internal working of 
udacity feedback extension. With the knowledge developed so far, i shall be incorporating the same workflow 
in my other web application projects .
